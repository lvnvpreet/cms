Okay, I have analyzed the server/package.json file. Here's a summary of the key technologies and libraries being used:

Framework: Express.js (express) is the core web framework.
Language: TypeScript (typescript, ts-node) is used for development.
Database: PostgreSQL (pg) is the database driver, suggesting direct interaction or a custom query layer rather than a full ORM like Prisma or TypeORM.
Authentication: Uses bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken (JWT) for session/token management.
Security: Implements helmet for security-related HTTP headers and express-rate-limit for preventing brute-force attacks.
File Handling: multer is used for file uploads, sharp for image processing, mime-types for identifying file types, and archiver for creating zip files.
Configuration: dotenv is used to manage environment variables.
Logging: Both pino (with pino-pretty) and winston are listed, suggesting potentially multiple logging mechanisms or a transition.
Email: nodemailer indicates the capability to send emails.
Other Utilities: Includes cors for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, uuid for generating unique IDs, ms for time string parsing, csso for CSS optimization, and terser for JavaScript minification.
In summary: This is a robust TypeScript Express.js backend connected to PostgreSQL, featuring JWT authentication, file upload/processing capabilities, email sending, and standard security practices.

Next Steps:

Now that we have a better understanding of the technology stack, we can dive into specific implementation details. Here are a few options:

Explore Database Configuration: We could look at server/config/database.ts and server/src/db/connection.ts to see how the database connection is set up.

Next Steps & Considerations:

While the core logic is in place, several pieces are still needed to make this fully functional within the application:

Database Schema: Ensure the users table exists in your PostgreSQL database with the correct columns (id, username, email, passwordHash, role, etc.). You might need to create a migration script.
Route Registration: The routes defined in server/src/routes/auth.routes.ts need to be updated to use these controller methods (AuthController.login, AuthController.register).
App Setup (app.ts): The main Express application needs to:
Use middleware to parse JSON request bodies (e.g., express.json()).
Register the authentication routes (auth.routes.ts).
Implement and register a central error handling middleware to catch errors passed via next(error) and send formatted responses (using formatErrorResponse from utils/errors.ts).
Input Validation: Add validation (e.g., using Zod or Joi) in the controller methods to sanitize and check req.body before passing it to the service.
We have completed the initial goal of implementing the core authentication flow logic in the queries, service, and controller.

Examine Authentication Logic: We could review server/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts, server/src/services/auth/, and server/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts to understand the user authentication flow.
Review API Routes: We could check server/src/routes/index.ts and related files in server/src/routes/ to see the defined API endpoints.
Investigate a Specific Feature: If you have a particular feature in mind (e.g., site creation, deployment, media handling), we could trace the code starting from its controller (server/src/controllers/).















Overall Server Analysis Summary:

Based on the files examined (package.json, config/database.ts, models/user.model.ts, services/auth/*, controllers/auth.controller.ts, controllers/user.controller.ts, db/connection.ts, db/queries/user-queries.ts):

Technology Stack: The server is set up to use Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. It includes libraries for authentication (JWT, bcrypt), security (Helmet, rate-limiting), file handling (Multer, Sharp), etc.
Structure: The project follows a standard backend structure with distinct layers for configuration, controllers, services, models, database interactions (queries), and utilities.
Implementation Status: The core application logic appears to be largely unimplemented. Key files across controllers, models, services (implied), and database queries contain placeholder code, TODO comments, and example structures rather than functional implementations. The database connection pool is configured, but the code to actually use it for CRUD operations seems absent in the areas we checked.
Suggested Next Steps:

Given that the server-side functionality is mostly scaffolded but not built, we have a few options:

Start Implementation: We could begin implementing the missing pieces. A good starting point would be the user authentication flow:
Implement the actual database queries in user-queries.ts (e.g., findUserByEmail, createUser).
Create and implement the UserService and AuthService referenced in the controllers.
Fill in the logic within AuthController and UserController methods to use these services.
Explore Other Areas: We could check other query files (like site-queries.ts) or service directories (sites/, deploy/) to see if any other features are implemented, though the pattern suggests they might also be placeholders.
Focus Elsewhere: We could shift focus back to the client/ directory or discuss other aspects of the project if the backend isn't the immediate priority.
